# Bulkan
This repository contains low-level [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org) bindings for Vulkan.
These binding were generated using [Bulkan.Generator](https://github.com/jayrulez/Bulkan.Generator).

# *Note*
These bindings won't work with the stable version of Beef (0.43.1). Due to taking advantage of several fixes that have gone into Beef since, you will need to use the nightly version *01/22/2022* or later. You can grab a compatible version [here](https://nightly.beeflang.org/index.html).
