# Bulkan
This repository contains low-level [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org) bindings for Vulkan.
These binding were generated using [Bulkan.Generator](https://github.com/jayrulez/Bulkan.Generator).

# *Note*
These bindings won't work with the stable version of Beef. Due to taking of several fixes that have gone into Beef since, you will need to use the nightly version *01/22/2022* or later. You can grab a compatible version [here](https://nightly.beeflang.org/index.html).
